# flight-delay-prediction

The main goal of this project was to make a machine learning model which intakes flight info and returns information if plane will be delayed more than 60 minutes. Models tested: logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, SVM.

Dataset used: "The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations."
